# Changelog

All notable changes to RiskKernel are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once `v0.1.0` ships.

We ship loudly: every user-facing change lands here, and the stability of each
surface is governed by [`COMPATIBILITY.md`](COMPATIBILITY.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Public contract (`api/v1`)** — OpenAPI 3.1 spec for the versioned REST surface:
  `POST /v1/runs`, `GET /v1/runs/{id}`, `POST /v1/runs/{id}/approve`,
  `POST /v1/runs/{id}/cancel`, `GET /v1/checkpoints/{run_id}`, `POST /v1/policies`.
  This is the frozen contract Product 2 (and all SDKs) consume.
- **`COMPATIBILITY.md`** — backwards-compatibility stability charter.
- **`SECURITY.md`** — security posture and the verifiable no-telemetry promise.
- **OTel GenAI attribute set** pinned in `api/v1/otel-genai.md`.
- **Provider abstraction** — `Provider` interface returning token usage; native
  Anthropic Messages implementation; OpenAI / Bedrock / Ollama stubbed.
- **`riskkernel serve`** — daemon skeleton with health and version endpoints.
